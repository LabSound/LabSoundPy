# LabSoundPy

Python bindings for the LabSound audio engine.

This project is very much work in progress and does not yet compile. It's published in case anyone wants to pitch in to help write it.


## Overview

LabSoundPy provides a Pythonic interface to LabSound's audio processing capabilities, making it as simple and intuitive to use as JavaScript-based Web Audio API while leveraging Python's strengths and ecosystem.

## Features

- **Pythonic Interface**: A wrapper that feels natural to Python developers
- **Graph-Based Audio Processing**: Node-based programming model for audio processing
- **NumPy Integration**: Seamless integration with NumPy for audio data manipulation
- **Comprehensive Node Types**: Support for all standard Web Audio API node types
- **Custom Processing**: Create custom audio processing with Python functions
- **Context Management**: Use Python's context managers for resource handling

## Installation

```bash
# Coming soon
pip install labsoundpy
```

## Quick Start

```python
import labsound as ls

# Create an audio context with context manager
with ls.AudioContext() as ctx:
    # Create nodes
    osc = ctx.create_oscillator()
    gain = ctx.create_gain()
    
    # Set parameters
    osc.frequency.value = 440  # A4 note
    gain.gain.value = 0.5      # Half volume
    
    # Connect nodes
    ctx.connect(osc, gain)
    ctx.connect(gain, ctx.destination)
    
    # Start and stop the oscillator
    osc.start(0)
    osc.stop(2)
    
    # Wait for completion
    ctx.wait(2.5)
```

## Node Types

LabSoundPy supports the following node types:

- **AnalyzerNode**: For real-time frequency and time-domain analysis
- **AudioBufferSourceNode**: For playing back pre-recorded audio
- **BiquadFilterNode**: For filtering audio with various filter types
- **ChannelMergerNode**: For combining multiple audio channels
- **ChannelSplitterNode**: For splitting audio into multiple channels
- **ConstantSourceNode**: For generating a constant value
- **ConvolverNode**: For applying convolution effects (e.g., reverb)
- **DelayNode**: For delaying audio
- **DynamicsCompressorNode**: For dynamic range compression
- **FunctionNode**: For custom audio processing with Python functions
- **GainNode**: For controlling audio volume
- **OscillatorNode**: For generating audio tones
- **PannerNode**: For 3D audio positioning
- **StereoPannerNode**: For simple stereo panning
- **WaveShaperNode**: For non-linear distortion effects

## Examples

### Spatial Audio

```python
import time
import math
from labsound import AudioContext

# Create an audio context
with AudioContext() as context:
    # Create an oscillator as our sound source
    oscillator = context.create_oscillator()
    oscillator.frequency.value = 440  # A4 note
    
    # Create a panner node for 3D positioning
    panner = context.create_panner()
    panner.panning_model = "HRTF"  # Head-related transfer function
    
    # Connect the oscillator to the panner, and the panner to the destination
    context.connect(oscillator, panner)
    context.connect(panner, context.destination)
    
    # Start the oscillator
    oscillator.start()
    
    # Move the sound source in a circle around the listener
    radius = 5  # 5 units away from the listener
    for i in range(100):
        angle = (i * 0.1) % (2 * math.pi)
        x = radius * math.sin(angle)
        z = radius * math.cos(angle)
        
        # Update the panner position
        panner.set_position(x, 0, z)
        
        # Wait a bit before the next update
        time.sleep(0.1)
    
    # Stop the oscillator
    oscillator.stop()
```

### Custom Processing with NumPy

```python
import numpy as np
from labsound import AudioContext

# Create an audio context
with AudioContext() as context:
    # Create an oscillator as our sound source
    oscillator = context.create_oscillator()
    oscillator.frequency.value = 220  # A3 note
    
    # Create a function node for custom processing
    function_node = context.create_function(channels=1)
    
    # Define a custom processing function
    def bit_crusher(channel, buffer):
        # Apply a bit crusher effect (reduces bit depth)
        bits = 4  # Reduced bit depth
        step = 2.0 ** (bits - 1)
        
        for i in range(len(buffer)):
            # Quantize the sample to the reduced bit depth
            buffer[i] = np.floor(buffer[i] * step) / step
    
    # Set the processing function
    function_node.set_process_function(bit_crusher)
    
    # Connect the nodes
    context.connect(oscillator, function_node)
    context.connect(function_node, context.destination)
    
    # Start the oscillator
    oscillator.start()
    
    # Let it play for 3 seconds
    context.wait(3)
```

## Development

### Building from Source

There are two ways to build LabSoundPy from source:

#### Option 1: Using Git Submodules (Recommended)

This approach automatically fetches and builds the required dependencies (nanobind and LabSound) as git submodules.

```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/labsoundpy.git
cd labsoundpy

# Or if you've already cloned without --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build the extension (this will use submodules by default)
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

#### Option 2: Using Installed Dependencies

If you prefer to use system-installed versions of the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/labsoundpy.git
cd labsoundpy

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build using installed dependencies
USE_SUBMODULES=0 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Note: This approach requires that you have LabSound installed and findable by CMake.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```
